<h3>Tez takes us through an important Hint from the Hut, Saddle Stitching.</h3>

<p>With a few upcoming Maker Kits this technique will be used quite often and is a skill needed to put your kits together. This is a very simple technique and in this video Tez talks us through it step-by-step on how to perfect saddle stitching. Specifically done for demonstration purposes, Tez uses upscales the materials typically used and talks us through the stitching technique with corflute and hay band to show you this technique on a larger scale. As Tez says, consistency is key, so as you stitch through down the line, make sure to keep it taught and neat.</p>
